# DisasterMapOfChina Trying to illustration the political, social and humanitarian disasters.

This map is inspired by a Twitter user, who @ me and some other guys with an angry handler, "I hate Tiananmen". He/she may not realized it's never an ending with those disasters in this state. So a version control is necessary, to map not only the past, but the future in real time.

By using Github's in-line function to show geojson format(https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/), this map conversioning control can become reality.
